# MySQL

Sakila Database, created by MySQL, is a normalized schema modelling a DVD rental store featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals. In this project, basic to advanced level queries (involving joins) were written for retrieving information from the database tables.
